This library contains a sans-io_ implementation of the MQTT_ v5 protocol.

Contents:

* State machines appropriate for implementing MQTT_ clients and brokers
* Asynchronous client and broker implementations, compatible with both Trio_ and
  asyncio_, via the AnyIO_ library
* Synchronous client implementation, implemented by using an asyncio_ event loop thread
  behind the scenes

While the provided client I/O implementations are intended for production use, the
broker implementation should only be used in very lightweight scenarios where high
performance or a broad feature set are not required. In those cases, broker
implementations from vendors like EMQX_ or HiveMQ_ are recommended instead.

The state machine implementation tries to adhere to the MQTT v5 protocol as tightly as
possible, and this project has certain automatic safeguards to ensure correctness:

* Ruff_ linting
* Passes Mypy_ in strict mode
* Documentation built with "fail-on-warning" enabled
